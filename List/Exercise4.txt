Follow the instructions below to complete the List class we worked on in the lab (03/14/18).

-----------------------------------------

Use the List class you worked on in the lab as a base and add the following methods (List class functions):

1. implement a delete by value function* **:    

    void deleteByVal(DataType data);

* The function should search the list for a value and if it is found remove it from the list

** DataType is the typedef you defined in Node.h: typedef int DataType;

2. implement a delete by position function* **:    

    void deleteByPosition(int pos);

* The function should traverse the list and remove a value at the specified pos.

** The first element in the list is at position 1, the last element is at position N (where N is size of list)

3. implement an insert by position function * ** ***:    

    void insert(int pos, DataType data);

* The function should traverse the list and insert a value at the specified pos.

** The first element in the list is at position 1, the last element is at position N (where N is size of list)

*** DataType is the typedef you defined in Node.h: typedef int DataType;

4. Write a driver program to test the new features (you can add the tests to the existing main)

5. Submit your source files and output examples
