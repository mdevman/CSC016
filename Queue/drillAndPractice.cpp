/*---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Drill-and-Practice Program that generates random drill-and-practice 
  addition problems.  Problems that are answered incorrectly are 
  queued and asked again until all are answered correctly or maximum
  number of tries is reached.

  Input:  Number of problems to generate, student's answers to
          problems
  Output: Messages, problems, correct answers, number of problems
          answered correctly

  Note:   Program assumes that Queue.h contains a declaration of a 
          class Queue like that described in Sections 7.2 and 7.3
	          whose elements are of type AdditionProblem.  An alternative
          is to use the C++ standard queue class template by making
          the following changes: 
            #include "Queue.h" --> #include <queue>
            Queue wrongQueue --> queue<AdditionProblem> wrongQueue
            enqueue --> push
            dequeue --> pop
